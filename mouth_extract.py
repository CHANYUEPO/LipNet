This is the code behind the Switching Eds blog post:
    http://matthewearl.github.io/2015/07/28/switching-eds-with-python/
See the above for an explanation of the code below.
To run the script you'll need to install dlib (http://dlib.net) including its
Python bindings, and OpenCV. You'll also need to obtain the trained model from
sourceforge:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/files/dlib/v18.10/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
Unzip with `bunzip2` and change `PREDICTOR_PATH` to refer to this file. The
script is run like so:
    ./faceswap.py <head image> <face image>
If successful, a file `output.jpg` will be produced with the facial features
from `<head image>` replaced with the facial features from `<face image>`.
